        javascript, unlike CSS, should be included last; that is because
        if we want to touch HTML elements with functions such as document.getElementById,
        first we need to make sure that they already exist!
        You may have seen $(document).ready() or DOMContentLoaded,
        but really the simplest way is to put the script just before </body>.
